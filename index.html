      <h1 class="subHeader">PAS Pain Tracker </h1>
      <p>PAS Pain Tracker was another team project however it was created in a team of 5 for a client. This project aimed to create a mobile app which would allow users that suffered from chronic pain
        to record when and where they felt pain. This was designed so that users could keep a record of any pain experienced and this record could be used to more accurately
        describe the symptoms they experienced when they visited the doctor. This project was completed using Android Studio, coding mainly in Java as well as SQL for the backend Database.

      <p>This project was undertaken as my Fourth Year Dissertation. It involved performing extensive research into the previous work done on Graph Drawings and Community detection.
        A number of experimental stimuli were created using the LFR benchmark before an online experiment was performed using a custom made website. The website was created by myself using 
        a mix of HTML, CSS and JavaScript with the results being stored in a Google Firestore database. From the data gathered from my experiment was used in a paper which will be publsihed in the ASONAM-2020 Graph Drawing
        Conference.

      <p>My current project is being completed as part of my Masters' degree. Using the foundational knowledge I gained from my fourth year project I am attempting to introduce an element of machine learning such that when presented with a number of 
        metrics describing a graph drawing the machine learning algorithm should be able to determine which graph drawing algorithm produced the drawing.
